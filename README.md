# Hello-World

This is the readme! Not sure what I'm meant to write here but here are three
things about me!
1). I've had an interest in programming since I was 12 (and wrote my first program around that time)
2). My first program I set out to write was an "operating system" using batch commands
3). I consider myself fluent in: Java, C#, Python, Visual Basic, VBA, HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, PHP

Thanks for reading!
